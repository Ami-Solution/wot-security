     This document provides non-normative guidance on Web of Things (WoT) security and privacy.
     The Web of Things is descriptive, not prescriptive, 
     and so is generally designed to support the security models and mechanisms of the systems it describes,
     not introduce new ones.
     However, a WoT system also has its own unique assets, such as a Scripting API and Thing Descriptions, that
     need to be protected and also have security and privacy implications.
     
     We define the general security requirements for a Web of Things system using a threat model.
     The WoT threat model defines the main security stakeholders, security-relevant assets, possible attackers, attack surfaces, 
     and finally threats for a WoT system.
     Using this generic WoT threat model as a foundation, 
     it should be possible to build a specific set of security objectives for a concrete WoT system implementation.
     We provide several examples using common scenarios based on home, enterprise, and industrial use cases.
     We also provide more general guidance on the design and deployment of a secure WoT system.
     All recommendations are linked to the corresponding WoT threats in the generic woT threat model in order to 
     facilitate understanding why they are needed. 

     It is not the intention of this document to limit the set of security mechanisms that can be used to 
     secure a WoT network.  
     In particular, while we provide examples and recommendations based on the best available practices in the industry,
     this document contains informative statements only.
     Specific normative security aspects of the WoT specification are defined in the corresponding normative WoT documents
     for each WoT building block.

        <section>
        <h2>General</h2>
            <p>
            In general using the WoT approach should "do no harm": the security of any protocols should be maintained.
		        The Web of Things systems does not introduce new security mechanisms, 
            but should preserve the functionality of existing mechanisms.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Exposing:</strong>
                When exposing a TD, especially via the Scripting API,
                it should be possible to use best practices for security,
                including maintaining the integrity of the TD and delivering it only to an authorized recipient.</li>
                <li><strong>Consuming:</strong>
		            A consumed TD should accurately reflect the actual security status of a target device.</li>
                <li><strong>Protocols:</strong>
		            We will ensure in particular that, at a minimum, 
                the needs of the following protocols are addressed: http(s) and coap(s).</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="wot-threat-model">
        <h2>Threat Model</h2>
            <p> 
              Due to the large diversity of devices, use cases, country regulations and requirements for WoT Things,
              it is impossible to draw a precise picture of a WoT threat model that would fit every case.
              Instead we have created an overall WoT threat model that can be adjusted
              by OEMs or WoT deployers based on their concrete security requirements.
            </p>
            <p class="ednote" title="Make tables look visually acceptable">
              All tables in Threat model and Security objectives sections are currently look horrible and need fixing.
              Also emphasis on the keywords should be added back to improve readability.

                            (loss of reputation, possible legal consequences in some countries).
                            Want to satisfy security requirements of solution users 
                            and solution providers for better sales.</td>
			<td></td>
		    </tr><tr>
			<td>Solution provider (solution integrator)</td>
			<td>Uses things from OEMs to build various WoT end solutions
                            specific to particular WoT use case(s).
                            OEM might also be a solution provider at the same time.
                            Might define new TDs for things or modify TDs provided by manufacturers.
                            Might use scripting API and runtime provided to implement their solution
                            or might do a full reflash of the thing.
                            Solution provider's scripts and their configuration data might require 
                            confidentiality and/or integrity</td>
			<td>Don't want their solution to be a target of attacks
                            (loss of reputation, possible legal consequences in some countries).
                            Want to satisfy security requirements of solution users for better sales.
                            Don't want security to interfere with usability for better sales (usability vs. security). 
                            Want solution to be robust and not easily falling down to DoS
                            (at least basic DoS resistance).
                            Want to hide their proprietary scripts and other relevant data from other parties.
                            <br /><strong><em>Any security obligations towards OEMs?</em></strong></td>
			<td>There might be several independent solution providers on a single HW Thing.
                            Need to be able to support their isolation within WoT runtime,
                            as well as sharing solution user preferences.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Solution user</td>
<td>This might be physical user(s) (as John and his family in their smart home) or an abstract user (as company running the factory). Solutions users might differ in their access to the WoT solution capabilities and transferred data (might be able to configure certain parts of solution only or only use solution as it is).</td>
<td>Don&#39;t want their data to be exposed to any other solution user, solution provider or OEM unless intended (Data confidentiality).Don&#39;t want their data to be modified unless intended (Data integrity).</td>

</tr>

</table>

<p>In addition to the above stakeholders, we might need to define a notion of &quot; <strong>Security Owner</strong>&quot;. It defines an entity that provisions a thing with the security root of trust and sets up initial policies on who can provision/update/remove scripts to/from the WoT runtime, if such model is supported. WoT might generally have a number of independent security owners, each with its own set of provisioned certificates and/or credentials. The exact hierarchy of owners that WoT wants to support is to be discussed. <strong><em>Todo: this needs more discussion.</em></strong></p>

<h3>Attack surfaces</h3>

<p>In order to correctly define WoT attack surfaces one needs to determine the system's trust model as well as execution context boundaries. Figure 1 presents high-level view on WoT architecture from the security point of view with all possible execution boundaries. However, in practice certain execution boundaries might not be present and it is dependent on the actual device implementation.</p>

<th><strong>Notes</strong></th>

<tr>
<td><strong>Scripts execution boundary</strong></td>
<td>Separates execution contexts between different scripts and script-provided thing instances. If present, this boundary should be implemented either as having different script runtime contexts (with WoT runtime isolation means) or by having separate process execution contexts (with OS process isolation means)</td>
<td>This boundary is required if we assume that WoT Runtime can run untrusted scripts</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>WoT execution boundary</strong></td>
<td>Separates execution contexts between WoT runtime (including Protocol Bindings) and the rest of the system. If present, this boundary should be implemented at least with OS process isolation means, but in addition can be implemented using stronger security measures available on the device (Mandatory Access Control, OS-kernel level virtualization, Full Virtualization etc.)</td>
<td>This boundary is required if we assume that WoT Runtime might run untrusted scripts or there might be untrusted Protocol Bindings present. It is also required if a device also runs a non-WoT SW stack and elements of that stack can be compromised</td>

<h3>Threats</h3>

<p>This section lists all basic WoT threats, both in-scope and out-of-scope. </p>

<p>It is important to note that this threat model assumes that WoT User Interface (that might reside on non-WoT device, such as smartphone, PC browser, etc.) communicates with WoT network using standard WoT Interfaces and WoT Protocol Bindings. It is strongly recommended that no other separate communication mean is provided for this purpose. It is also assumed that WoT Protocol Bindings are trusted and cannot come from untrusted parties.    </p>

        <h2>Security Objectives</h2>
            <p>
              Practical examples of typical high-level WoT scenarios and their security objectives are given here.   
            </p>

<section>
<h3>Scenario 1 - Home environment</h3>

<p>In this scenario we assume a standard home environment with a WoT network running behind a firewall that separates it from the rest of the Internet. However the WoT network is shared with the standard user home network that contains other non-WoT devices that have high chances of being compromised. This results on viewing these non-WoT devices as network attackers with access to WoT network and its APIs/Protocol Bindings. WoT scripts and protocol bindings are considered trusted, single solution provider exists on physical WoT devices, no dynamic installation of WoT scripts are possible.</p>

<p>This scenario implies the following <strong>WoT Security objectives</strong>:</p>

<table>

<tr>
<th><strong>Threat name</strong></th>
<th><strong>Example(s)</strong></th>
<th><strong>Mitigation</strong></th>
</tr>


<tr>
<td><strong>WoT Protocol Bindings</strong></td>
<td>A compromised application on a user smartphone connected to the same internal network as WoT devices sends a malformed request to a WoT device using directly Protocol Bindings interface. This malformed request causes the respective Protocol Binding to be compromised and attacker is able to run the code with the privileges of the Protocol Binding on the WoT device.</td>
<td>TBD</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>WoT Interface - General Compromise</strong></td>
<td>A compromised application on a user smartphone connected to the same internal network as WoT devices sends a malformed request to a WoT device using WoT interface. This malformed request causes the respective Thing Instance to be compromised and attacker is able to run the code with the privileges of the Thing Instance on the WoT device.</td>
<td>TBD</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>WoT Interface - Unauthorized API access</strong></td>
<td>A user's party guest with the network access to the same internal network as WoT devices using his device sends a WoT interface request to a user's WoT device for a certain resource access, for example, to get a video stream from user's video camera footage or permission to unlock some rooms in the house. Due to lack of proper authentication, it is able to access this information or execute the required action (opening the door).</td>
<td>TBD</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>WoT communication - TD Authenticity</strong></td>
<td>A compromised application on a user smartphone connected to the same internal network as WoT devices listens to the network and intercepts a legitimate TD send by one of the WoT devices. Then it modifies the TD to state different authentication method or authority and forwards it to the intended device. The device follow the instructions in the modified TD and sends authentication request to the attacker's specified location potentially revealing its credentials, such as keys etc. Similarly instead of modifying the legitimate TD, an attack might save it and use later on, for example when it would be updated to a newer version. Then, an attacker substitutes a new version of TD with an older version to cause DoS to a device trying to get an access to a resource. An additional reason for using an older TD might be exposing a previously available vulnerable interface that got hidden when TD was updated to a newer version. This can be a stepping stone to conducting other attacks on the WoT network.</td>
<td>TBD</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>WoT communication - TD Confidentiality</strong></td>
<td>A user's party guest with the network access to the same internal network as WoT devices using his device listens to the network and intercepts a legitimate TD send by one of the WoT devices. While inspecting the TD he/she learns the privacy-sensitive information about the host, such as presence of medical tracking/assistant equipment, name of healthcare provider company etc.</td>
<td>TBD</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>WoT communication - Solution Data Authenticity</strong></td>
<td>A user's party guest with the network access to the same internal network as WoT devices using his device listens to the network and intercepts a legitimate WoT interface request to set some settings on some actuator, for example the time when house doors get locked and unlocked. He then modifies the specified value to the desirable one and then forwards the request to the destination WoT device. The destination WoT device accepts incorrect settings.<br />Another attack example is a replay of a legitimate WoT interface request to set a setting, for example, increase temperature of the house by a number of degrees. When repeated many times, it might not only make living environment unusable, but also break heating equipment.<br />Another attack involves replaying an old legitimate WoT interface request that attacker intercepts while visiting user's home, such as command to unlock the doors, stop camera recordings etc. in a different time when user wants to get authorized access to the house.</td>
<td>TBD</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>WoT communication - Solution Data Confidentiality</strong></td>
<td>A user's party guest with the network access to the same internal network as WoT devices using his device listens to the network and intercepts WoT interface exchange between legitimate entities. From that exchange the guest learns the privacy-sensitive information about the host, such as data stream from his medical tracking equipment, information about user's preferences in home environment, video/audio camera stream etc.</td>
<td>TBD</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>WoT DoS</strong></td>
<td>A compromised application on a user smartphone connected to the same internal network as WoT devices sends huge amount of requests to either a single WoT device or all device available in the WoT network using directly Protocol Bindings interface or WoT interface. These requests fully take the processing bandwidth of a WoT device or WoT network and make it impossible for legitimate users to communicate with WoT devices or devices to communicate with each other. Depending on the implementation it can also lead to the case that alarm or authentication systems might be disabled and thieves get into user's house (however systems should always implement "safe defaults" principle and in such cases keeps doors closed despite of inability to authenticate).</td>
<td>TBD</td>
</tr>
<tr>

                (depending on whenever a TD contains any confidential information)
                to avoid manipulation of a TD. 
            </p>
            <p>
              If end-to-end TD authenticity is required,
              it is possible to sign TD objects with either digital signatures 
              (using asymmetric cryptographic primitives) 
              or Message Authentication Codes (MACs, using symmetric cryptographic primitives).
              Such digital signatures or MACs are created by the producers/issuers of TD objects
              and validated by consumers of TD objects (which should reject signed TD objects whose signatures/MACs are invalid).
              For TD objects expressed in JSON,
              RFC 7515 (IETF JSON Web Signature: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7515/)
              provides guidelines for computation and validation of digital signatures or MACs using JSON-based data structures. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Similarly, if end-to-end TD confidentiality is required
              (though probably a much more rare case than authenticity),
              it is possible to encrypt TD objects using available cryptographic encryption primitives.
              For TD objects expressed in JSON,
              RFC 7516 (IETF JSON Web Encryption: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7516/)
              provides the guidelines for encryption and decryption of JSON-based data structures. 
  	          When TD is stored at the end device or remote storage,
              its authenticity and in some cases confidentiality should
  	          also be protected using the best available local methods.
              An access control mechanism should also be used that prevents 
  	          illegitimate modification of any of the TD's parts. 
            </p>
            <p>
  	          This recommendation helps prevent the following threats: 
              WoT Communication - TD Authenticity,
              WoT Communication - TD Confidentiality,
              WoT TD - Local Storage.

        <h3>Use Secure Transports</h3>
            <p> 
	           When defining protocols for APIs exposed by a TD, 
             it is often important to use secure protocols guaranteeing
	           data authenticity and confidentiality.
            For example, coaps and https should be preferred to coap and http whenever possible.
            </p>
            <p>
	          This recommendation helps prevent the following threats: 
            WoT Communication - Solution Data Authenticity,
            WoT Communication - Solution Data Confidentiality.

	     <h3>Avoid Heavy Functional Processing without Authentication</h3>
            <p>
  	          When defining WoT Interfaces exposed by a TD,
              it is important to avoid any heavy functional processing before the successful authentication
  	         of a WoT client.
              Any publicly exposed network interface should avoid heavy processing altogether. 
            </p>
            <p>
	           This recommendation helps prevent the following threats: 
            WoT DoS.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
	      <h3>Avoid Exposing Immutable Identifiers</h3>
            <p>
	           When defining fields exposed by a TD personally identifiable information should be avoided.
	           It is also strongly recommended to avoid exposing any immutable hardware identifiers.
             Instead it is recommended to use "soft identifiers", i.e. identifiers that can be changed during device lifecycle.
            </p>
            <p>
	          This recommendation helps prevent the following threats: 
            WoT TD - Privacy.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
	      <h3>Minimize Network Interface Functionality</h3>
            <p>
	          Network interfaces exposed by a TD (WoT Interfaces) should only provide the minimal necessary functionality,
            which helps to minimize implementation errors,
	         possibilities for exposing potentially sensitive data, DoS attack possibilities etc.  
	         Devices should be strongly encapsulated, meaning the network interfaces should not expose implementation details
            (for example, the use of particular software frameworks).
	         Consider different levels of access for different users.
            </p>
            <p>
	         This recommendation helps prevent the following threats: 
            WoT Interface - General compromise, 
            WoT Interface - Unauthorized API access, 
            WoT DoS.

    <h1>Examples of WoT security configurations</h1>
        <p>
          WoT is intended to be used in variety of use cases and configurations. While the below list does not cover all possible deployment variations, it covers
          the most common cases and shows the ways how security mechanisms can be configured for them, as well brings attention to the relevant details.
        </p>

           <section>
           <h2>Basic Interaction between WoT Thing and WoT Client</h2>
            <p>
              Here we will consider two cases. <a href="#wot_client_thing_basic"></a> shows the basic WoT Client (can be a browser or application on a user smartphone) that is used to operate the WoT Thing (Garage door controller or other HW device). The latter exposes a WoT interface and provides a Thing Description with actions that can be performed on a Thing. 
            </p>

              <figcaption>Basic WoT Thing and WoT Client</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
            Todo: Here we will talk about the ways how the security association between the WoT Client and WoT Thing can be provisioned (WoT Client needs to be able to authenticate WoT Thing), as well as how WoT Thing can setup access control mechanisms on exposed WoT Interface (x509 certs, OAuth, access tokens etc.). 
            We will give examples and suggestions for security mechanism usages based on different device classes (limited resource devices, more powerful devices etc.).
            Also, we will list point to the threats from the Threat model document that are important to consider in this case, such as TD authenticity in transfer and others. 
            </p>
            <p>
            <a href="#wot_client_thing_basic_2"></a> is identical but with an important difference that a Thing description is not stored on a WoT Thing device, but provided to the WoT client from Things Directory residing on a remote cloud.
            </p>
            <figure id="wot_client_thing_basic_2">

              Todo: In addition to the above described things, we will discuss issues around secure TD provisioning from the Cloud here.

          <h2>Interaction between WoT Thing and WoT Client via WoT Servient Gateway</h2>
            <p>
              Here we will also consider two cases. <a href="#wot_client_thing_gateway"></a> shows the same basic WoT Client (can be a browser or application on a user smartphone) that is used to operate the WoT Thing (Garage door controller or other HW device). However in contrast to previous case, the interaction between WoT Client and WoT Thing happens via WoT Servient Gateway. The latter exposes a WoT interface and provides a Thing Description with actions that can be performed on a Thing.

            <h2>WoT Servient Single-Tenant</h2>
            <p>
              <a href="#wot_servient-single-tenant"></a> shows the WoT Servient (for example providing Garage door controller) with Scripting API support and a couple of scripts running inside WoT runtime. All scripts are coming from a trusted entity.

            <p>
            Todo: Here we will take a deeper look inside of WoT Servient and Scripting API and discuss the security-related issues and threats. Things to cover: script provisioning and provisioning of security metadata, possibility to setup different access controls on different TDs and actions that different scripts expose. 
            We will give examples and suggestions for security mechanism usages based on different device classes (limited resource devices, more powerful devices etc.).
            We will also talk at the end of possibility to use capabilities to group related accesses and giving AC permissions to the group.

            <p>
              <a href="#wot_servient-multi-tenant"></a> shows the WoT Servient (for example providing Garage door controller) with two different tenants running in two different instances of WoT Runtime. Each tenant can have multiple independent scripts. WoT Runtime core also has a Thing manager entity that allows installation of scripts into the corresponding WoT runtimes. 
            </p>
